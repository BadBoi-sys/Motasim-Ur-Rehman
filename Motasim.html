    <p id="para1">Mohammad Babar Azam (Urdu, Punjabi: محمد بابر اعظم; pronounced [Muhamməd babəɾ azəm]; born 15 October 1994) is a Pakistani international cricketer and the former captain of the Pakistan national cricket team in all three formats of the game. A right-handed top-order batter, he captains Peshawar Zalmi in the PSL.[2]

        He is Pakistan's most prolific T20I batter, and scored 122 (59) against South Africa in his maiden T20I century, which is the highest individual score in T20Is by any Pakistani cricketer.[3] He also remains the only captain to take Pakistan to the number 1 ODI team rankings. Azam was a member of the Pakistan team that won the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy.[4][5]
        
        In November 2023, Azam resigned from captaincy in all formats after the 2023 Cricket World Cup.[6] However, in March 2024, he was reappointed as Pakistan's captain in white-ball cricket.[7]
        
        In June 2024, Azam became the most prolific run-scorer of all time in T20 internationals, in a match against the United States in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup group stage.[8][9][10]
        
        On 1 October 2024, Azam resigned from the white-ball captaincy for a second time, citing his workload and desire to focus on his batting</p><br>
